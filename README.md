# Overview
### This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop a neural network-based model for predicting total runs in an IPL match.
### The model considers various factors such as venue, batting and bowling teams, key players, and real-time match statistics like runs, wickets, and overs. 
### By preprocessing the data, encoding categorical features, and applying deep learning methods, the model aims to provide highly accurate predictions.
### Additionally, an interactive UI is implemented, allowing users to input match details and obtain predictions in real time. 
### The goal is to create a robust and scalable system that enhances cricket analytics, helping teams and enthusiasts make informed decisions.
